Processes from design to development
Type of work, I assume it's always enhancing and perfecting the product but there would be some other aspects of general web design?
Culture:
Do you have developers who think like designers?
Staff who are passionate and want to create a great product?
Staff that don't just treat the job as a pay cheque?
Do you have a team environment where collaboration is a big deal?
