# Please, for the love of bacon, don't...

#### Patterns & methodologies...
- Manipulate the DOM directly.
    - This means no jQuery, Prototype, Mootools. Ever.
- Mutate references
    - The pain this causes is our primary complaint with AngularJS' & $scope

#### Libraries, frameworks, tools etc...
- Use Angular
    - The 1.x branch is abandoned, and the 2.x branch is unfinished.
    - It tends to produce a nasty mess after a while. The maintainers know this, and that's why Angular 2 doesn't look similar.
- Use Bootstrap
    - Unless Bootstrap is the brand, this will be more work than it's worth.
- Use Bower
    - NPM + Babel + Browserify (or Webpack), please.
- Use Ember
    - The learning curve has bitten us on a few projects. React is easier to use in small pieces, and to learn.
- Use Grunt
    - Gulp is faster and friendlier.
- Use jQuery, Prototype, Mootools, etc.
