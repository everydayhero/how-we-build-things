# Leader system
The sub-system acting as the authority for the data in question. It encapsulates all logic for this area of business capability, and is responsible for providing suitable access to all authorized consumers.

# Follower system
A sub-system which aggregates information from multiple leaders. A reporting system might, for example, maintain useful representations of data that cross many leader systems. JOINing customer-supplied metadata with fundraising page performance is a good example of this pattern.

# OLTP
On line transaction processing, or OLTP, is a class of information systems that facilitate and manage transaction-oriented applications, typically for data entry and retrieval transaction processing.

# OLAP
OLAP (online analytical processing) is computer processing that enables a user to easily and selectively extract and view data from different points of view. For example, a user can request that data be analyzed to display a spreadsheet showing all of a company's beach ball products sold in Florida in the month of July, compare revenue figures with those for the same products in September, and then see a comparison of other product sales in Florida in the same time period. To facilitate this kind of analysis, OLAP data is stored in a multidimensional database. Whereas a relational database can be thought of as two-dimensional, a multidimensional database considers each data attribute (such as product, geographic sales region, and time period) as a separate "dimension." OLAP software can locate the intersection of dimensions (all products sold in the Eastern region above a certain price during a certain time period) and display them. Attributes such as time periods can be broken down into subattributes.

# Semantic event

# Entities
